1. Clone the repository

    First, clone the repository from Github. It is recommended to fork the repository to your Github account before cloning it to your system.
    Use the following command to clone the forked repository: git clone https://github.com/noobkanger/Assignment-L1-DO.git
    Use the ls command to confirm that all the files have been cloned.

2.  Install Docker

    Update your system by running the following command: sudo apt update -y
    Install Docker by running the following command: sudo apt install docker.io

3. Move to the app directory

    Move the aesthisia-demo directory to your home directory by running the following command: mv aesthisia-demo ~
    Move to your home directory by running the following command: cd ~
    Access the aesthisia-demo directory by running the following command: cd aesthisia-demo

4. Write a Dockerfile

    Use a text editor of your choice (such as nano or vi) to create a new file called Dockerfile in the aesthisia-demo directory.

5. Build a Docker image

    Use the following command to build a Docker image from the Dockerfile: docker build -t react_project . (the dot at the end tells Docker that the Dockerfile is in the current directory)
    Wait for the image to build.

6. Run the container

    Use the following command to run the container in detached mode on port 3000: docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name react react_project
    The React app should now be running in a Docker container.
    Access the app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
